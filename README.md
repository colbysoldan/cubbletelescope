- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Colby.
- I'm in the stage of learning where it feels like taking a drink from a fire hose. Focusing on one thing has proven difficult. I've done a couple of projects in HTML/CSS, but I'm trying to work on C# at the moment.
- Starting May 23, I'll be in a full time software engineering course, so I'll basically be living at my computer for the summer.
